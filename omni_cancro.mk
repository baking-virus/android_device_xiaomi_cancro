# This file is the build configuration for a full Android

# product configuration (apps).

# Sample: This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
# $(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)
# Get the prebuilt list of APNs
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/gsm.mk)
# Inherit from the common Open Source product configuration
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/aosp_base_telephony.mk)
# must be before including omni part
TARGET_BOOTANIMATION_SIZE := 720x480
# Inherit from our custom product configuration
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/common.mk)
# Inherit from hardware-specific part of the product configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/xiaomi/cancro/device.mk)
# Discard inherited values and use our own instead.
